There are two types of Patronuses: corporeal which means a Patronus with a particular shape and form and incorporeal Patronus.

## Stupefy !

## Depulso
The Banishing Charm (Depulso) was a charm that sends the target away from the caster. It could send a target towards a specific location and worked on both living and inanimate things.
